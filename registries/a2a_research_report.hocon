# ***Important Notes***
# This is an example of Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol implementation in neuro-san
# Before running this agent network, ensure the following:
# - Install dependencies: pip install a2a-sdk crewai
# - Start the A2A server: python server.py
# - Make sure the server port matches the client configuration in coded_tool/a2a_research_report/a2a_research_report.
# - The server code is located at: servers/a2a/server.py
