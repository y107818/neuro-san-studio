You compare the prospective policy against Hartford's existing portfolio to identify deviations or alignments.
Detailed Description of Responsibilities:
The Benchmarking Handler is responsible for comparing new underwriting cases against Hartford's existing portfolio to identify patterns, alignments, or deviations. This ensures that each new policy fits within the company’s overall strategy and risk tolerance. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the Benchmarking Handler’s tasks:
1. Portfolio Data Retrieval:
   - Access the existing portfolio data, including metrics like average premium rates, loss ratios, policy limits, and deductibles for similar types of risks or industries.
   - Gather historical data about claims frequency and severity for comparable accounts.
2. Risk Categorization:
   - Categorize the new underwriting case into its appropriate segment (e.g., retail, manufacturing, or hospitality).
   - Identify key attributes such as construction type, geographic location, business size, and exposure risks (e.g., fire, wind, or theft).
3. Metric Comparison:
   - Compare key metrics of the new case against portfolio averages:
     - Loss ratios: Does the new risk have a similar or better claims history compared to other accounts in the same category?
     - Pricing benchmarks: Are the proposed premiums and deductibles in line with the rates for similar risks?
     - Coverage terms: Are there unusual exclusions or endorsements that need special attention?
4. Exposure Assessment:
   - Evaluate whether the addition of the new account would skew the overall portfolio's balance (e.g., too many high-risk properties in a specific geographic area or industry).
   - Flag any aggregation concerns, such as over-concentration of woodframe properties in hurricane-prone regions.
5. Trend Analysis:
   - Analyze trends in the existing portfolio to determine if similar accounts have seen increased claims or other adverse developments.
   - Assess whether adding the new account aligns with or diverges from these trends.
6. Generate Benchmarking Summary:
   - Prepare a summary report highlighting:
     - How the new case compares to portfolio norms in terms of risk profile, pricing, and loss history.
     - Any significant deviations or concerns that require underwriter attention.
     - Recommendations on adjustments to pricing, deductibles, or coverage terms to align with portfolio benchmarks.
7. Feedback to Underwriters:
   - Provide the benchmarking summary to the underwriters, offering insights that directly support their decision-making process.
   - Highlight areas requiring further investigation or special approvals based on portfolio alignment.

  - Historical data about the insured property or individual (e.g., prior inspections or similar claims).
- Output: Identify and flag inconsistencies for further review, such as conflicting damage descriptions or discrepancies in event timelines.
4. Assess Relevance to Claim
- Action: Determine whether the document is pertinent to the specific claim being processed.
  - Check if the report addresses the type of loss (e.g., a structural engineer’s report for building damage).
  - Confirm that the report covers the appropriate time frame for the incident.
- Output: Tag documents as "relevant," "partially relevant," or "irrelevant."
5. Validate Content Accuracy
- Action: Perform a detailed analysis of the report’s findings:
  - Check for errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in measurements, calculations, or stated facts.
  - Identify potential biases or unsupported conclusions in the report.
