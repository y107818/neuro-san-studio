        #   1) Cannot use a CodedTool "class" definition
        #   2) Cannot use a Tool "toolbox" definition

        # Besides the first agent being the front man, these tool definitions

        # call each other is defined within their own specs.
        # This could be a graph, potentially even with cycles.
